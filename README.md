# RENX

## Roadmap
- Lunalib settings support
- Add more configurable
- Support Corvus
- Incoporate reduced accessibility due to hostility (see Ruthless Sector)
- Reduce relations if friendly to enemy (RS is too slow, we will make a new one)
- New unique hullmods, weapons, hulls, shipsystems, structures
- Successful raid/invasion randomly gives attacker blueprints (?)
- Research for creating new ships
